# NOTICE: OLD CODE
This project was originally done whilst I was in Sixth Form and was before I had experience coding professionally, as such it doesn't contain any dependancies and has some junior-esque code. However I've kept it around because it can show how far I've come

# SnakeAI
I made the game of Snake with AI's instead of players.
I used an algorithm called 'Wave Propogation', which starts at the target node, sets the score to 0, then every adjacent node gets a score thats +1 higher, which then repeats for all of those nodes.
